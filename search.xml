    <url>%2F2018%2F06%2F10%2FJava-Tutorial-03%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Abstract:The lectures here will introduce the how the exception works in Java, the steps we need to do while importing new package and detail information about synchronization in Java. Lecture 10: Exception1. Definition: Exception happens during the execution time.[1] Thowable: Cannot be solved exception: Error class, is throwed by jvm, which infect our program badly, which cannot be dealt with. Can be solved: Exception class. [2] throws and throw: Anything can be decorated by the two key words are throwable. [3] object-&gt;throwable-&gt;error/exception. [4] throw exeception from class function to main to jvm to print on the control panel (default). The following function will not continue, just end of program. We can make ourself handler instead of the default function. [5] Exceptions construct functions have 3 types, including transmitting nothing, transmitting error index and transmitting String buffer. (Check the manul pdf) [6] If we want to change the name of exeception in java. We can follow the class of Exception. If want to make a class to be an exception child class. In this case, not only we need to throw the self-defined exception in the line, but also we need to use throws after the name of the functions from the used function to the main function and finally to the JVM. [7] Difference between throw and throws: Exception: being checked during compiling exception and run time exception (exception caused by the user or the change of inner state). Runtime Exception and its child class do not need to use throws to throw the exception out of function to upper function like main function. Self-defined Exception extends Exception or RuntimeException. Difference: Throws is used after the name of the function, while throw is used inside the funcction. Throws can throws multiple exceptions class seperated by “,”, while throw throws one exception object. 2. Try catch.[1] If we do not throw the Exception, we have two ways to do: Mention and define the Exception, “throw” the new object and “throws” the new built class. try and catch. This happen after the place the problem really happen. Not in the place where “throw” the exception, but the user (upper level) to “try catch” this exception instead of throwing to the jvm. [2] defination: 123456789101112try&#123; //code needs to be checked with exception.&#125;catch(ExceptionClass variable)// being used to recieve the exception objects&#123; //Solution of exception&#125;finally&#123; //code must be executed&#125; “try catch” and “try catch finally” two types. If the problem is dealt with successfully, then the program will continue executing. Exception class will present the exception information instead of hashtable value as the normal class while printing. [3] Muiltiple catch problem: Multiple catch, then the parent exception should be put in the below. [4] Finally: It is used to executed even we return after return during the error. (Demo3) [5] If one exception is the child of a parent exception, then only the child exception or its parent exception can be threw out. If we catch the parent exception. -&gt; Fu f = new Zi(); If parent exception throw a number of exception, then the child exception should only throw the exception equal or under the parent exception. If parent exception does not throw exception then the child should not throw, just try. 1234567891011121314151617interface Inter throws A,B,C&#123; void function();&#125;class D implements Inter throws A,B(A/B/A,B,C/B,C/nothing)&#123; public void function();&#125;/********************************************************/interface Inter&#123; void function();&#125;class D implements Inter throws Exception// error, should use try catch in the function.&#123; public void function();&#125;]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Abstract:The lectures here will introduce the basic defination and ways to use the class probably including construct function, inheritaion, interface, abstract class and etc. Lecture 05: Class and object 01 1. Defination:[1] basic definatio of class and object: 123456789101112131415class Car&#123; int num; String color; void run() &#123; sop(num + ", " + color); &#125;&#125;Car c = new Car();c.run();c.color;c.num; [2] member: variable and function. [3] Storage: The object is created and stored in the heap, then the data heap will be initialized as null or 0 when being created. [4] member variables and local variables: member variables are defined in the class, which can be visited in side the class; local variables are defined in a function, region ir a statement, valid inside the defination area. member variables exist in the object of a class of heap; local variable exists in the function of stack. member variables appears with the objects. The local variables appears with the region. member variables [5] anonymous object: e.g. new Car().run(); -&gt; If we only want to use the function instead of creating the whole object. Function of a class be used once; Being used as transferring parameters; (show(new car())) [6] Two cases: 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435class Demo1&#123; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; int x = 3; show(3); System.out.println("x = " + x); &#125; public static void show(int x) &#123; x = 4; &#125;&#125;//x in the show is 4, x in the main is 3, output is 3;class Demo2&#123; int x = 3; public static void main(String[] args) &#123; Demo2 d = new Demo2(); d.x = 9; show(d); System.out.println("x = " + d.x); &#125; public static void show(Demo2 d) &#123; d.x = 4; &#125;&#125;//x is 9 of the object d. [7] Encapsulation: provide function to let others to read or write the private variables in the class: 1234567891011private int age = 10;public void setAge(int a)&#123; age = a;&#125;public int getAge()&#123; return age;&#125; Lecture 06: Class and object 02 1. Construct function:[1] The same name with class name; no return value; [2] For one object, construct function can only be used once. [3] this: condition 1: local variable has the same name with member variable. &quot;this&quot; means the pointer to the object who use this -&gt; member variable. Actually, this is hidden when use the each member variable. condition 2: &quot;this&quot; can be used to help communicate among construct function: this(x) -&gt; one construct function can use another construct function. First execute the other construct function(must exist in the first line) then mine, else error may happen. [4] static: Make the varibale/function to be shared by all of the object. Make the varibale/function to be shared by the class. The static varibale/function exists with the appearance of class. Static function can only use the static member varibale/function. Non-static can visit all. “this” and “super” keyword can not be used. (this.x is changed by the className.x) main function is static. When to use static. Keep the variable as a constant without change in class; static region(static{}), This part is executed when the first time the class is built. Construct region({} in class) can be used to initialized each objects of the class. Lecture 07: Class and object 03 1. Makeup for class:[1] If there are more than we need to javac each of the class. [2] Expression: single example design: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425class Single&#123; private static Single s = new Single(); private Single()&#123;&#125; public static Single getInstance() &#123; return s; &#125;&#125;class Single&#123; private static Single s = null; private Single()&#123;&#125; public static Single getInstance() &#123; if(s == null) s = new Single(); return s; &#125;&#125; 2. Inherit:[1] e.g. class Student extends Person{}; [2] single inherit and multiple inherit. (C++ has multiple inherit, but java cannot) single inherit: one child has one parent; multiple inherit: one child has multiple parent. problem with multiple inherit: if In the two parent two function with the same name may cause uncertainty. If child has the variable, we do not search its parent (override), if local area contains the variable, we do not need to search the member variables. “this” is used to seperate the local and member variable. “super” is used to seperate the child and parent variable. child cannot get the private varaible/function from its parent. Create the child class’s object, then build its parent object. (there is a super() hidden in child class) Override: child’s priority should be equal to or over than parent priority. (default priority &lt; public) Static can only override or be overrided by static. Example: show(){//update; super.show();} -&gt; use super to extend parent’s function. Lecture 08: Class and object 04 1. Makeup for class:[1] In the child class, there is a hidden super() to construct the parent first. [2] If we have this, then we do not need super, because the this will will use the default construct function, then the super in the default construct function will build the parent construct function. [3] Every class extends from the object(root). [4] When a object is built, the construct function is built first, then comes the other initialization, no matter the location of the construct function. [5] When a child object is built and the parent and child class contains the function with the same name and parameters, the construct function in its parent class will first search the function in child class. Because this is a child object. 2. final keyword:[1] If we want to use the method in its parent, while there is a function with the same name in child class, the function in parent will be banned. [2] final keyword will prevent child class extends the function. [3] final can use for function, variable and class which will not be inherited. [4] If the member is decorated by final, we usually use public static final to solid the variable. 3. Abstract class:[1] Both the class name and its member should be decorated by abstract. [2] abstract class cannot be built (e.g. new Parent()). [3] abstract class must has child class. [4] abstract has construct function for child class; abstract can be empty; abstract class cannot be decorated by private, static, final; abstract class can include abstract function and normal function. 4. Interface:[1] When the function of a abstract class are all abstract, we can use the keyword interface to represent this function. [2] Substitude class by interface. [3] Member of interface: global variable: public static final. abstract function: public abstract. The variable and function can be initialized as above if we do not give enough decoration. [4] The implement class must override all of the abstract function in the interface, or the class is abstract class which needs child to realize the other abstract functions. [5] On function an implement multiple interface. If two interface has the same function, one function in the class will implement all of them. [6] Extenstion with inheritation and implement. 12345678910class Q&#123; public void method() &#123;&#125;&#125;class Test2 extends Q implements A,B&#123; //&#125; [7] interfaces can be parent &amp; child relationship among themselves, and they can be multiple inherit. Because there is not function implements. Lecture 09: Class and object 05 1. Polymorphism：[1] improve the class: Animal a = new Cat(); a is a class from Cat to Animal, the function of Animal can be used but special function of Cat cannot be used. It is used to restrict the special implement of function. Afterwards if we still need to use the special function, we need to downgrade the object: Cat c = (Cat) a; However we cannot convert an parent object into child object. [2] instanceof: a instanceof Cat -&gt; used to judge the class/interface specific type. a instanceof parent, a instanceof child, to be more specific. In order to avoid the case like (Cat c = (Cat) a). [3] Override only happen in member function, but not happen in member variables. Member variables: Compiling and Excuting type follow the left type. Member function: Compiling follows the left, while excuting follows the right. Static function: Because Static belongs to class not object, thus; Compiling and Excuting type follow the left type. 2. Inner class:[1] Expression: Outer$Inner.class. [2] Inside class can directly visit outside member, while the outside class need to build object to visit inside member. [3] Other outside class visit the inside member: Outer.Inner in = new Outer.new Inner(); If the inside class is private, the outer other class cannot visit the inside class. [4] static class inner(): The inner appears when the outer class is built. Then the inner() class is like a outer class. Then Outer.Inner in = new Outer.Inner(); The outer object does not need to be built. (If the member function in the inner class is static then the inner class should be static either). [5] Inner class has the reference to outer class: Outer.this. [6] Inner class can be put in the local area: like inside the function of Outer class. If the function want to use the function inside the inner class, it needs to build object to realize this problem. If the inner class need to use the local variable of the function outside, then the variable outside needs to decorated by final. (include the variable in the function “()”) [7] Inner class should be static if the member function of the outer class is static and it wants to build the inner class. Anonymous inner class:[1] The inner class must extends or implements a outer class or interface. [2] As usual, the number of functions in the abstract class should be smaller than or equal to 3. [3] Difference between Object obj = new Object() and new Object() -&gt; The first one build the Object, while the second is converted into the anonymous class.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Abstract:This part we start to introduce the basic rules and how to compile the algorithm with Java in detail. The first part will introduce some very basic staff. If I miss something important, please let me know in the comment area. Lecture 01: Hello world! 1. Basic Code:1class Demo 1public static void main(String[] arg) 2. Two kinds of print:[1] System.out.println(“”): print with enter in the end [2] System.out.print(“”): print with enter in the end 3. Compile java file and execute java file:[1] Compile java file to .class file and check the error. 1javac &lt;name&gt;.java [2] execute java file. 1java &lt;name&gt;.class 4. Java makefile.5. Java set classpath, executing the .class file under the folder we need. (Temporary); p.s. %CLASSPATH% means the already pointed path.The only path to find without ‘;’ 1set classpath=&lt;path&gt; (e.g. c:\myclass) The first path to find in the path, then to the following path. 1set classpath=&lt;path&gt;; Firstly search the path in the upper folder, then to the pointed path. 1set classpath=.;&lt;path&gt; 6. public class Demo: only if the class name and the file name keep the same, then the file will be compiled. Lecture 02: Basic gramma 1 1. Keywords:[1] class, interface, byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean, void; true, false, null; if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue, return; private, protected, public, abstract, final, static, synchronized, extends, implements; new, this, super, instanceof, try, catch, finally, throw, throws; package, import; native, strictfp, transient, volatile, assert. [2] p.s. The name of class should start with upperclass. 2. Identifiers:[1] Rule: (Use to define the name) Include 26 Uppercase/lowercase letters, 0-9, _ and $; Cannot start with 0-9; Cannot use Keywords. 3. Comments:[1] Example: Demands &lt;…&gt;; Thought &lt;…&gt;; Steps &lt;…&gt; 4. Constants and variables:[1] Constants: values cannot be changed. (int, float, boolean, ‘’char(ASCII), “”String, null) Default: decimal, 0… -&gt; Oct; 0x… -&gt; Hex; Complement: 0000-0110 -&gt; 1111_1001 + 0000_0001 = 1111_1010 [2] Variables: bytes(8 bits(-128-&gt;+127)), short(16 bits), int(32 bits), long(64 bits); default: int float(32 bits), double(64 bits); default: double; char(2 bits) boolean class interface [] [3] Conversion: Automatic type convert: x = b + 1; (x’s type decide the final type) Convert: y = (int)x; b = b1 + b2 -&gt; might lose accuarcy if b,b1 and b2 in the same type, because the b1 and b2 may change, then the sum might over the limit.(e.g. byte) For the default type like int, the answer will not be alarmed to loss accuarcy, however actually the accuarcy may lose. Caculation[1] Compute: ‘/‘ interger divide; ‘%’; ++, –; short s = 3; s += 4 / s = s + 4;The second one may cause error, because the sum may over the limit making the accuarcy loss. However, the first one, the error may not happen, the automatic conversion may happen, then the alert may be avoided. (s = (short)(s + 4) -&gt; s += 4) [2] Comparison: &amp;, |, ^, !; e.g.(x&gt;2 &amp; x&lt;5) &amp;&amp; and ||: if left false/true for &amp;&amp;/||, the right part will not be executed &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &gt;&gt;&gt;, &amp;, |, ^, ~: &gt;&gt;&gt;: unsigned left shift 1 (x&gt;1)?100:200 Lecture 03: Basic gramma 21. Function:[1] Overload: In the same class; With the same name; different number of parameters or parameters with different types; 2. Array:[1] Defination: Start with 0; Defination: int[] arr = new int[5]; int[] arr = new int[] {3,5,1,7}; int[] arr = {3,5,1,7} initial with default 0; The array is actually created during the execution time instead of compiling, so if the index is out of range, the error will be reported only during the execution time. The array will point to nothing, if we let arr = null. [4] Storage; Stack: store the local variables. Heap: store the arrays, objects(created by new) and global variables, main. (default: float: 0.0f; double: 0.0; boolean: false; char ‘\u0000’). Each thing in the heap contains a header address; Each variable in the heap is initialized in the default value. The useless buffer int the heap can be recycled automatically, while C++ need to use destructor function to deal with this problem. Lecture 04: Basic gramma 31. Array (make up):[1] two types of array defination: 12int[] arr = new int[]&#123;1, 2, 3, 4&#125;;int[] arr = &#123;1, 2, 3, 4&#125;; Normally for reading the 1 and 2 are the same, however there are tiny different between the two defination for transferring new value.(1: dynamic; 2: static) [2] int[] arr = new int[3]; (arr.length) [3] decimal to hex: 123n1 = num &amp; 15;num &gt;&gt;&gt; 4;n2 = num &amp; 15; 2. 2-D Array[1] Defination: First create 3 then 2. 1int[][] arr = new int[3][2]; multi-steps: 1234int[][] arr = new int[3][];arr[0] = new int[2];arr[1] = new int[1];arr[2] = new int[3]; column length = arr.length, row length = arr[i].length; define the array while each element is known; 1int[][] arr = &#123;&#123;3, 1, 7&#125;, &#123;5, 8, 2, 9&#125;, &#123;4, 1&#125;&#125;]]></content>

This blog is to conclude the function and tools that I need to use for developing my future blogs. In breif, the tutorial starts with basic ways of using Markdown and html language for beautifying the webpages, functions used under the frameworks of the Hexo and some plugins that can improve the type of media for the expression. Finally the reference of the source I might use and copyright might involve will be put in the end of the articles. Announcement:This is my first blog to record interesting things and the new cool things I studied recently. Everything I put on my blog may include objects of mine or others. (I will assign the author and the link at the end of the articals) These thoughts and objections may not right and may only represent my personal view.

Here are several steps to do to use the plugin. First install the hexo-tag-youku plugin in git bash under the folder of the Hexo: 1npm install hexo-tag-youku --save add the youku video as follow: 123&#123;% youku height width %&#125;youku_id&#123;% endyouku %&#125; Effects of video playing is shown as follow. youtube plugin. video player for cloud/local video. iframe for all types of videos. plugin for youku videos. p.s. Inorder to make the image and video player changing automatically to ensure different size of windows, we add this instead of real width and height. (Only useful for the some of video html clip and img html clip) 1style=&quot;max-width:100%; overflow:hidden&quot; musicThere is a plugin for playing music. Here are several steps to do to use the plugin.
